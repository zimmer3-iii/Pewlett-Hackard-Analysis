## Overview of Project

requires preperation to make sure there is a smooth transistion. The following was optained from the data files:
- The number of retiring employees per title.
- The employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Resources
- Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, titles.csv, salaries.csv
- Software: Python v3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook, anaconda v1.9.0, pgAdmin4 v6.8

	
## Results

- Total of 72,458 employee are getting ready to retire. The number of employees per title are:
	- 9,285 Engineers
	- 25,916 Senior Engineers
	- 2 Managers

- There are 1,940 employees that are eligible to enroll in the mentorship program. 	
- [See mentorship_eligibility here](https://github.com/zimmer3-iii/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" begins 72,458 roles will need to be fill or absorbed. The largest portion being some type of engineer, ~50% of all retiring employees.
There are only 1,940 employees eligible to help mentor. If every eligible employee for the mentorship program join, each one would need to take on an average of 38 employees
to replace the 72,458 employees retiring. This does not seem likely to work and additional resources and planning will be needed.
